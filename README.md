# Data Structures and Algorithms Project

This repository is a comprehensive collection of **data structures** and **algorithms**, implemented in Java. It is organized systematically to facilitate learning and practical implementation of key computer science concepts.

## **Folder Structure**

### **1. Data Structure**
#### **Graph**
- **Representations**:
  - `GraphAdjList.java` - Graph representation using adjacency lists.
  - `GraphAdjMatrix.java` - Graph representation using adjacency matrices.
- **MST (Minimum Spanning Tree)**:
  - `KruskalAlgorithm.java` - Kruskal's algorithm for MST.
  - `PrimAlgorithm.java` - Prim's algorithm for MST.
- **Searching**:
  - `GraphListBfsDfs.java` - BFS and DFS using adjacency lists.
  - `GraphMatBfsDfs.java` - BFS and DFS using adjacency matrices.

#### **List**
- `SinglyLinkedList.java` - Singly linked list implementation.
- `DoublyLinkedList.java` - Doubly linked list implementation.
- `SinglyCircularLinkedList.java` - Singly circular linked list.
- `DoublyCircularLinkedList.java` - Doubly circular linked list.

#### **Queue**
- `Queue.java` - Linked-list-based queue implementation.
- `QueueArrayBased.java` - Array-based queue implementation with dynamic resizing.

#### **Stack**
- `Stack.java` - Linked-list-based stack implementation.
- `StackArrayBased.java` - Array-based stack implementation with dynamic resizing.

#### **Tree**
- `BinaryTree.java` - Basic binary tree structure and operations.
- `BinarySearchTree.java` - Binary search tree implementation.
- `AVLTree.java` - Self-balancing AVL tree.
- `RedBlackTree.java` - Red-Black tree implementation.
- `Trie.java` - Prefix tree (trie) for string operations.

### **2. Shortest Path**
- `BellmanFord.java` - Bellman-Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths.
- `FloydWarshall.java` - Floyd-Warshall algorithm for all-pairs shortest paths.

---

### **3. Sorting**
#### **Comparison-Based Sorting**
- `BubbleSort.java` - Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- `SelectionSort.java` - Sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list and moves it to the sorted part.

#### **Non-Comparison-Based Sorting**
- `CountingSort.java` - A sorting technique based on keys between a specific range.
- `RadixSort.java` - A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that processes individual digits.

### **4. String Methods**
- **Documentation**:
  - `String Methods.md` - A detailed guide on various string manipulation methods available in Java.
